JavaKomododRpcClient
=====================

Java Komodod RPC Client is a lightweight Java komodo JSON-RPC client binding. It does not require any external dependencies.

This is a repackaging of the original tool described here https://en.komodo.it/wiki/Komodo-JSON-RPC-Client (with some small improvements and z_* functionality).
